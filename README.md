## Task
An environment is constructed(as asked in question) with april tags belonging to two distinct ids - 1 and 4, at its edges(20cm away from the edges, will explain the reason later). I couldn’t afford a 10ftx10ft space so like hw2/3/4, I’m doing this homework in the 2m x 2m space. Following is the pictorial representation of the arena and its corresponding image.
