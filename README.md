# Randomized-algorithm-for-area-coverage-by-JetBot

## Task
An environment is constructed(as asked in question) with april tags belonging to two distinct ids - 1 and 4, at its edges(20cm away from the edges, will explain the reason later). I couldn’t afford a 10ftx10ft space so like hw2/3/4, I’m doing this homework in the 2m x 2m space. Following is the pictorial representation of the arena and its corresponding image.

A robot is placed at a point in this arena. The task is to plan the motion of the robot to cover the entire 2m x 2m arena.

## Description of Planning Algorithm
I have used a randomized motion algorithm as my planning algorithm for this assignment. My motive was to create this assignment as close to the roomba’s random motion as possible.
I shall first discuss the architecture of the logical components of my randomized planning algorithm which will allow me to easily explain my algorithm.

## Architecture
Below is the diagram of logical architecture and control flow
